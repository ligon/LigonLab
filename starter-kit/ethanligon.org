* Set up for encryption
** Worg Tutorial
[2012-12-21 Fri 18:29] 
Following notes from
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/encrypting-files.html.
Note: On my pixelbook, it's important to use a graphical
pinentry program (e.g., pinentry-gtk2 and *not* pinentry-curses).

** Berndt Hansen's Crypt setup (adapted)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: HandlingEncryption
:END:

I used to keep my encrypted data like account passwords in a separate
GPG encrypted file.  Now I keep them in my org-mode files with a
special tag instead.  Encrypted data is kept in the org-mode file that
it is associated with.

=org-crypt= allows you to tag headings with a special tag =crypt= and
org-mode can keep data in these headings encrypted when saved to disk.
You decrypt the heading temporarily when you need access to the data
and org-mode re-encrypts the heading as soon as you save the file.

I use the following setup for encryption:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-crypt)
; Encrypt all entries before saving
(org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
(setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))
; GPG key to use for encryption
;(setq org-crypt-key "887A7D17") ;<ethan@ligon.org>
(setq org-crypt-key "DB876DAFD5CEB224E3B9F19C181C4B035BBCC53A") ; ligon@berkeley.edu
#+end_src

#+results:
: DB876DAFD5CEB224E3B9F19C181C4B035BBCC53A



=M-x org-decrypt-entry= will prompt for the passphrase associated with
your encryption key and replace the encrypted data where the point is
with the plaintext details for your encrypted entry.  As soon as you
save the file the data is re-encrypted for your key.  Encrypting does
not require prompting for the passphrase - that's only for looking at
the plain text version of the data.

I tend to have a single level 1 encrypted entry per file (like =*
Passwords=).  I prevent the =crypt= tag from using inheritance so that
I don't have encrypted data inside encrypted data.  I found =M-x
org-decrypt-entries= prompting for the passphrase to decrypt data over
and over again (once per entry to decrypt) too inconvenient.

I leave my entries encrypted unless I have to look up data - I decrypt
on demand and then save the file again to re-encrypt the data.  This
keeps the data in plain text as short as possible.

Capture mode now handles automatically clocking in and out of a
capture task.  This all works out of the box now without special hooks.
When I start a capture mode task the task is clocked in as specified
by =:clock-in t= and when the task is filed with =C-c C-c= the clock 
resumes on the original clocking task.

The quick clocking in and out of capture mode tasks (often it takes
less than a minute to capture some new task details) can leave
empty clock drawers in my tasks which aren't really useful.  Since I
remove clocking lines with 0:00 length I end up with a clock drawer
like this:

#+begin_src org :exports src

** Custom agenda views
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CustomAgendaViews
:END:

I now have one block agenda view that has everything on it.  I also
keep separate single view agenda commands for use on my slower Eee
PC - since it takes prohibitively long to generate my block agenda on
that slow machine.  I'm striving to simplify my layout with everything
at my fingertips in a single agenda on my workstation which is where I
spend the bulk of my time.

Most of my old custom agenda views were rendered obsolete when
filtering functionality was added to the agenda in newer versions of
=org-mode= and now with block agenda functionality I can combine
everything into a single view.

Custom agenda views are used for:
- Single block agenda shows the following
  - overview of today
  - Finding tasks to be refiled
  - Finding stuck projects
  - Finding NEXT tasks to work on
  - Show all related tasks
  - Reviewing projects
  - Finding tasks waiting on something
  - Findings tasks to be archived
- Finding notes
- Viewing habits

If I want just today's calendar view then =F12 a= is still faster than
generating the block agenda - especially if I want to view a week or
month's worth of information, or check my clocking data.  In that case
the extra detail on the block agenda view is never really needed and I
don't want to spend time waiting for it to be generated.

My block agenda view looks like this when not narrowed to a project.
This shows top-level projects and =NEXT= tasks but hides the project details since
we are not focused on any particular project.

[[file:block-agenda-nonproject.png]]

After selecting a project (with =P= on any task in the agenda) the block agenda changes to show the project and
any subprojects in the Projects section.  Tasks show project-related tasks that are hidden when not
narrowed to a project.

This makes it easy to focus on the task at hand.

[[file:block-agenda-project.png]]

I generally work top-down on the agenda.  Things with deadlines and
scheduled dates (planned to work on today or earlier) show up in the
agenda at the top.

My day goes generally like this:

- Punch in (this starts the clock on the default task)
- Look at the agenda and make a mental note of anything important to deal with today
- Read email and news
  - create notes, and tasks for things that need responses with org-capture
- Check refile tasks and respond to emails
- Look at my agenda and work on important tasks for today
  - Clock it in
  - Work on it until it is =DONE= or it gets interrupted
- work on tasks
- Make journal entries (=C-M-r j=) for interruptions
- Punch out for lunch and punch back in after lunch
- work on more tasks
- Refile tasks to empty the list
  - Tag tasks to be refiled with =m= collecting all tasks for the same target
  - Bulk refile the tasks to the target location with =B r=
  - Repeat (or refile individually with =C-c C-w=) until all refile tasks are gone
- Mark habits done today as DONE
- Punch out at the end of the work day
*** What do I work on next?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: WhatDoIWorkOnNext
:END:

Start with deadlines and tasks scheduled today or earlier from the
daily agenda view.  Then move on to tasks in the =Next Tasks= list in
the block agenda view.  I tend to schedule current projects to 'today'
when I start work on them and they sit on my daily agenda reminding me
that they need to be completed.  I normally only schedule one or two
projects to the daily agenda and unschedule things that are no longer
important and don't deserve my attention today.

When I look for a new task to work on I generally hit =F12 SPC= to get
the block agenda and follow this order:

- Pick something off today's agenda
  - deadline for today (do this first - it's not late yet)
  - deadline in the past (it's already late)
  - a scheduled task for today (it's supposed to be done today)
  - a scheduled task that is still on the agenda
  - deadline that is coming up soon
- pick a NEXT task
- If you run out of items to work on look for a NEXT task in the current context
  pick a task from the Tasks list of the current project.
**** Why keep it all on the =NEXT= list?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CustomAgendaViewsNextList
:END:

I've moved to a more GTD way of doing things.  Now I just use a =NEXT=
list.  Only projects get tasks with =NEXT= keywords since stuck projects
initiate the need for marking or creating =NEXT= tasks.  A =NEXT= task
is something that is available to work on /now/, it is the next
logical step in some project.

I used to have a special keyword =ONGOING= for things that I do a lot
and want to clock but never really start/end.  I had a special agenda
view for =ONGOING= tasks that I would pull up to easily find the thing
I want to clock.

Since then I've moved away from using the =ONGOING= todo keyword.
Having an agenda view that shows =NEXT= tasks makes it easy to pick
the thing to clock - and I don't have to remember if I need to look in
the =ONGOING= list or the =NEXT= list when looking for the task to
clock-in.  The =NEXT= list is basically 'what is current' - any task
that moves a project forward.  I want to find the thing to work on as
fast as I can and actually do work on it - not spend time hunting
through my org files for the task that needs to be clocked-in.

To drop a task off the =NEXT= list simply move it back to the =TODO=
state.
*** Reading email, newsgroups, and conversations on IRC
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ReadingMailNewsIRC
:END:

When reading email, newsgroups, and conversations on IRC I just let
the default task (normally =** Organization=) clock the time I spend on
these tasks.  To read email I go to Gnus and read everything in my
inboxes.  If there are emails that require a response I use
org-capture to create a new task with a heading of 'Respond to <user>'
for each one.  This automatically links to the email in the task and
makes it easy to find later.  Some emails are quick to respond to and
some take research and a significant amount of time to complete.  I
clock each one in it's own task just in case I need that clocked time
later.

Next, I go to my newly created tasks to be refiled from the block
agenda with =F12 a= and clock in an email task and deal with it.
Repeat this until all of the 'Respond to <user>' tasks are marked
=DONE=.

I read email and newgroups in Gnus so I don't separate clocked time
for quickly looking at things.  If an article has a useful piece of
information I want to remember I create a note for it with =C-M-r n=
and enter the topic and file it.  This takes practically no time at
all and I know the note is safely filed for later retrieval.  The time
I spend in the capture buffer is clocked with that capture note.
*** Filtering
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CustomAgendaViewFiltering
:END:

So many tasks, so little time.  I have hundreds of tasks at any given
time (373 right now).  There is so much stuff to look at it can be
daunting.  This is where agenda filtering saves the day.

It's 11:53AM and I'm in work mode just before lunch.  I don't want to
see tasks that are not work related right now.  I also don't want to
work on a big project just before lunch... so I need to find small
tasks that I can knock off the list.

How do we do this?  Get a list of NEXT tasks from the block agenda and
then narrow it down with filtering.  Tasks are ordered in the NEXT
agenda view by estimated effort so the short tasks are first -- just
start at the top and work your way down.  I can limit the displayed
agenda tasks to those estimates of 10 minutes or less with =/ + 1= and
I can pick something that fits the minutes I have left before I take
off for lunch.
**** Automatically removing context based tasks with / RET
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CustomAgendaViewFilteringContext
:END:

=/ RET= in the agenda is really useful.  This awesome feature was
added to org-mode by John Wiegley.  It removes tasks automatically by
filtering based on a user-provided function.

At work I have projects I'm working on which are assigned by my
manager.  Sometimes priorities changes and projects are delayed to
sometime in the future.  This means I need to stop working on these
immediately.  I put the project task on =HOLD= and work on something
else.  The =/ RET= filter removes =HOLD= tasks and subtasks (because
of tag inheritance).

At home I have some tasks tagged with =farm= since these need to be
performed when I am physically at our family farm.  Since I am there
infrequently I have added =farm= to the list of auto-excluded tags on
my system.  I can always explicitly filter to just =farm= tasks with
=/ TAB farm RET= when I am physically there.

I have the following setup to allow =/ RET= to filter tasks based on
the description above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun bh/org-auto-exclude-function (tag)
  "Automatic task exclusion in the agenda with / RET"
  (and (cond
        ((string= tag "hold")
         t)
        ((string= tag "home")
         t))
       (concat "-" tag)))

(setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'bh/org-auto-exclude-function)
#+end_src

This lets me filter tasks with just =/ RET= on the agenda which removes tasks I'm not
supposed to be working on now from the list of returned results.

This helps to keep my agenda clutter-free.
* Time Clocking
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2012-08-03 Fri 07:13]--[2012-08-03 Fri 07:35] =>  0:22
:END:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Clocking
:END:

Okay, I admit it.  I'm a clocking fanatic.

I clock everything at work.  Org-mode makes this really easy.  I'd
rather clock too much stuff than not enough so I find it's easier to
get in the habit of clocking everything.

This makes it possible to look back at the day and see where I'm
spending too much time, or not enough time on specific projects.  This
also helps a lot when you need to estimate how long something is going
to take to do -- you can use your clocking data from similar tasks to
help tune your estimates so they are more accurate.

Without clocking data it's hard to tell how long something took to do
after the fact.

I now use the concept of =punching in= and =punching out= at the start
and end of my work day.  I punch in when I arrive at work, punch out
for lunch, punch in after lunch, and punch out at the end of the day.
Every minute is clocked between punch-in and punch-out times.

Punching in defines a default task to clock time on whenever the clock
would normally stop.  I found that with the default org-mode setup I
would lose clocked minutes during the day, a minute here, a minute
there, and that all adds up.  This is especially true if you write
notes when moving to a DONE state - in this case the clock normally
stops before you have composed the note -- and good notes take a few
minutes to write.

My clocking setup basically works like this:

- Punch in (start the clock)
  - This clocks in a predefined task by =org-id= that is the default
    task to clock in whenever the clock normally stops
- Clock in tasks normally, and let moving to a DONE state clock out
  - clocking out automatically clocks time on a parent task or moves
    back to the predefined default task if no parent exists.
- Continue clocking whatever tasks you work on
- Punch out (stop the clock)

I'm free to change the default task multiple times during the day but 
with the clock moving up the project tree on clock out I no longer 
need to do this.  I simply have a single task that gets clocked in
when I punch-in.

If I punch-in with a prefix on a task in =Project X= then that task
automatically becomes the default task and all clocked time goes on
that project until I either punch out or punch in some other task.

My org files look like this:

=todo.org=:
#+begin_src org :exports src
,#+FILETAGS: PERSONAL
,...
,* Tasks
,** Organization
,PROPERTIES:
,CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL: today
,ID:       eb155a82-92b2-4f25-a3c6-0304591af2f9
,END:
,...
#+end_src

If I am working on some task, then I simply clock in on the task.
Clocking out moves the clock up to a parent task with a todo keyword
(if any) which keeps the clock time in the same subtree.  If there
is no parent task with a todo keyword then the clock moves back to
the default clocking task until I punch out or clock in some other
task.  When an interruption occurs I start a capture task which
keeps clocked time on the interruption task until I close it with
C-c C-c.

This works really well for me.

For example, consider the following org file:

#+begin_src org :exports src
,* TODO Project A
,** NEXT TASK 1
,** TODO TASK 2
,** TODO TASK 3
,* Tasks
,** TODO Some miscellaneous task
#+end_src

I'll work on this file in the following sequence:

1. I punch in with =F9-I= at the start of my day

   That clocks in the =Organization= task by id in my =todo.org= file.

2. =F12-SPC= to review my block agenda

   Pick 'TODO Some miscellaneous task' to work on next and clock that in with =I=
   The clock is now on 'TODO Some miscellaneous task'

3. I complete that task and mark it done with =C-c C-t d=

   This stops the clock and moves it back to the =Organization= task.

4. Now I want to work on =Project A= so I clock in =Task 1=

   I work on Task 1 and mark it =DONE=.  This clocks out =Task 1= and moves
   the clock to =Project A=.  Now I work on =Task 2= and clock that in.

The entire time I'm working on and clocking some subtask of =Project A=
all of the clock time in the interval is applied somewhere to the =Project A=
tree.  When I eventually mark =Project A= done then the clock will move
back to the default organization task.
** Clock Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ClockSetup
:END:

To get started we need to punch in which clocks in the default
task and keeps the clock running.  This is now simply a matter of
punching in the clock with =F9 I=.  You can do this anywhere.
Clocking out will now clock in the parent task (if there is one
with a todo keyword) or clock in the default task if not parent
exists.

Keeping the clock running when moving a subtask to a =DONE= state
means clocking continues to apply to the project task.  I can pick the
next task from the parent and clock that in without losing a minute or
two while I'm deciding what to work on next.

I keep clock times, state changes, and other notes in the =:LOGBOOK:=
drawer.

I have the following org-mode settings for clocking:

** Clocking in
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ClockingIn
:END:

When I start or continue working on a task I clock it in with any of the following:

  - =C-c C-x C-i= 
  - =I= in the agenda
  - =I= speed key on the first character of the heading line
  - =f9 I= while on the task in the agenda
  - =f9 I= while in the task in an org file
*** Setting a default clock task
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ClockingInDefaultTask
:END:

I have a default =** Organization= task in my todo.org file that
I tend to put miscellaneous clock time on.  This is the task I
clock in on when I punch in at the start of my work day with
=F9-I=.  While reorganizing my org-files, reading email,
clearing my inbox, and doing other planning work that isn't for
a specific project I'll clock in this task.  Punching-in
anywhere clocks in this Organization task as the default task.

If I want to change the default clocking task I just visit the
new task in any org buffer and clock it in with =C-u C-u C-c C-x
C-i=.  Now this new task that collects miscellaneous clock
minutes when the clock would normally stop.

You can quickly clock in the default clocking task with =C-u C-c
C-x C-i d=.  Another option is to repeatedly clock out so the
clock moves up the project tree until you clock out the
top-level task and the clock moves to the default task.
*** Using the clock history to clock in old tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ClockingInByClockHistory
:END:

You can use the clock history to restart clocks on old tasks you've
clocked or to jump directly to a task you have clocked previously.  I
use this mainly to clock in whatever got interrupted by something.

Consider the following scenario:

- You are working on and clocking =Task A= (Organization)
- You get interrupted and switch to =Task B= (Document my use of org-mode)
- You complete =Task B= (Document my use of org-mode)
- Now you want to go back to =Task A= (Organization) again to continue

This is easy to deal with.  

1. Clock in =Task A=, work on it
2. Go to =Task B= (or create a new task) and clock it in
3. When you are finished with =Task B= hit =C-u C-c C-x C-i i=

This displays a clock history selection window like the following and
selects the interrupted =[i]= entry.

*Clock history selection buffer for C-u C-c C-x C-i*

** Clock Everything - Create New Tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ClockEverythingWithNewTasks
:END:

In order to clock everything you need a task for everything.  That's
fine for planned projects but interruptions inevitably occur and you
need some place to record whatever time you spend on that
interruption.

To deal with this we create a new capture task to record the thing we
are about to do.  The workflow goes something like this:

- You are clocking some task and an interruption occurs
- Create a quick capture task journal entry =C-M-r j=
- Type the heading
- go do that thing (eat lunch, whatever)
- file it =C-c C-c=, this restores the clock back to the previous clocking task
- clock something else in or continue with the current clocking task

This means you can ignore the details like where this task really
belongs in your org file layout and just get on with completing the
thing.  Refiling a bunch of tasks later in a group when it is
convenient to refile the tasks saves time in the long run.

If it's a one-shot uninteresting task (like a coffee break) I create
a capture journal entry for it that goes to the diary.org date tree.
If it's a task that actually needs to be tracked and marked done, and 
applied to some project then I create a capture task instead which files it in 
refile.org.
** Finding tasks to clock in
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: FindTasksToClockIn
:END:

To find a task to work on I use one of the following options
(generally listed most frequently used first)

- Use the clock history C-u C-c C-x C-i
  Go back to something I was clocking that is not finished
- Pick something off today's block agenda
  =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= items that need to be done soon
- Pick something off the =NEXT= tasks agenda view
  Work on some unfinished task to move to completion
- Pick something off the other task list 
- Use an agenda view with filtering to pick something to work on

Punching in on the task you select will restrict the agenda view to that project
so you can focus on just that thing for some period of time.
** Editing clock entries
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: EditingClockEntries
:END:

Sometimes it is necessary to edit clock entries so they reflect
reality.  I find I do this for maybe 2-3 entries in a week.

Occassionally I cannot clock in a task on time because I'm away from
my computer.  In this case the previous clocked task is still running
and counts time for both tasks which is wrong.

I make a note of the time and then when I get back to my computer I
clock in the right task and edit the start and end times to correct
the clock history.

To visit the clock line for an entry quickly use the agenda log mode.
=F12 a l= shows all clock lines for today.  I use this to navigate to
the appropriate clock lines quickly.  F11 goes to the current clocked
task but the agenda log mode is better for finding and visiting older
clock entries.

Use =F12 a l= to open the agenda in log mode and show only logged
clock times.  Move the cursor down to the clock line you need to edit
and hit =TAB= and you're there.

To edit a clock entry just put the cursor on the part of the date you
want to edit (use the keyboard not the mouse - since the clicking on
the timestamp with the mouse goes back to the agenda for that day) and
hit the =S-<up arrow>= or =S-<down arrow>= keys to change the time.

The following setting makes time editing use discrete minute intervals (no rounding)
increments:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes (quote (1 1)))
#+end_src

Editing the time with the shift arrow combination also updates the
total for the clock line which is a nice convenience.

I always check that I haven't created task overlaps when fixing time
clock entries by viewing them with log mode on in the agenda.  There
is a new view in the agenda for this -- just hit =v c= in the daily 
agenda and clock gaps and overlaps are identified.

I want my clock entries to be as accurate as possible.

The following setting shows 1 minute clocking gaps.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks
      (quote (:max-duration "4:00"
              :min-duration 0
              :max-gap 0
              :gap-ok-around ("4:00"))))
#+end_src
** Automatically clocking tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: AutomaticallyClockingTasks
:END:

I spend time on an open source project called BZFlag.  During work for releases
I want to clock the time I spend testing the new BZFlag client.  I have a key
binding in my window manager that runs a script which starts the clock on my
testing task, runs the BZFlag client, and on exit resumes the clock on the 
previous clocking task.

The testing task has an ID property of
=dcf55180-2a18-460e-8abb-a9f02f0893be= and the following elisp code
starts the clock on this task.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

#+begin_src sh :results output
#!/bin/sh
